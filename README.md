# Node Pagination

Pagination Format NPM package for collections/entities. 


## Summary
The package allows you to transform a collection of objects into a paginated JSON response format with certain pagination parameters.

The package is able to slice the entire collection sent based on the `limit` and the `page` parameters that can be specified to the `paginate` method of the package, and therefore return just the portion of the collection needed, as a page, along with the related pagination params.

If no `page` or `limit` options are sent to the `paginate` method, the package will set those values to its default ones.

It is also posible to change the default values of the `page` and `limit` options to desired values, in such a way that the package will always paginate with certain behaviour desired defaultly without having to specify `page` and `limit` options everytime you want to paginate something.


## Installing
To install the package, just simply type in terminal:
```bash
$ npm i node-pagination
```

## Glossary
* `page` param: The page number that is being requested.
* `limit` param: The amount of objects needed in the page.
* `content` - `collection`: This is the group of objects you want to paginate. It should be an Array of objects.
* `request`: This is the `IncomingMessage` object you'll have to pass along with the other options needed to paginate.
* 'pagination params': These are the params that accompany the page itself (resulting objects), and are strictly related with the mentioned page that was requested. So far, the default pagination params are:
    - `page: Array` (As it was told, the resulting objects paginated)
    - `count: Number` (Describes the total of objects in the current page)
    - `total_pages: Number` (Describes the total of pages calculated, based in the total of objects sent to the paginator, and the limit requested)
    - `total_count: Number` (The total amount of objects that the paginator received)
    - `previous_page: Number` (The number of the previous page. Will be null if there's nothing to show)
    - `current_page: Number` (The number of the current page that is being shown)
    - `next_page: Number` (The number of the next page. Will be null if there's nothing to show)
    - `previous_page_url: String url` (A string url that leads to the previous page. Will be null if there's nothing to show)
    - `next_page_url: String url` (A string url that leads to the next page. Will be null if there's nothing to show)


## Usage
After installing the package, all you have to do is require it inside the file were you want to paginate something:
```js
const nodePagination = require('node-pagination');
```
Then, when you have the collection you want to paginate, you can make use of the `paginate` method of the package in any of the following ways

* Without specifying options (default options values will be used):
```js
const paginatedResponse = nodePagination.paginate(collection, request, {});
```

* Specifying the `page` option (as `limit` option is missing, the limit value will be the default one):
```js
const paginatedResponse = nodePagination.paginate(collection, request, { page: 2 });
```

* Specifying the `limit` option (as `page` option is missing, the page value will be the default one):
```js
const paginatedResponse = nodePagination.paginate(collection, request, { limit: 5 });
```

* Specifying both `page` and `limit` values:
```js
const paginatedResponse = nodePagination.paginate(collection, request, { page: 2, limit: 5 });
```

`collection`: This parameter could also be named as `content` and it represents the group of objects you want to paginate. This must be an Array, otherwise the `paginate` method will throw an error.
`request`: Used to concat a string url that leads to the previous and next pages. This should be an `IncomingMessage` object given that it uses the `request.headers.host` and `request.url` attributes to arrange a valid url string, otherwise those urls will return null.
`options`: An object containing options to modify the requested page. So far, only `page` and `limit` options are allowed.

### Default option values
* `page`: 1
* `limit`: 25

### Modifying default params
If you wanted to stablish different option values as defaults all you have to do is set the needed value to the corresponding option like this:
```js
nodePagination.defaultLimit = NEW_LIMIT;
nodePagination.defaultPage = NEW_PAGE;
```
It's recommended to do this on a setup/startup step of the applicacion that requires the tool, for example requiring it and changing its default values in a script that runs before a controller rendering the result using the tool itself.
